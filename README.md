# Port-Scanner

A port scanner is a tool used to scan a computer or network for open ports. It works by sending a series of network requests to a target machine, probing each port to determine if it is open, closed, or filtered. A port scanner can be used by network administrators to identify potential security vulnerabilities, or by attackers to find open ports that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to a system.
